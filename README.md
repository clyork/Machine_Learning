# Machine Learning Programs

This is a collection of what I have currently been learning and working with machine learning in both Python and R.

## Getting Started

This project is a file structure that contains all the scripts and data neccissary to run the various scripts. Just download the file structure and use Python or R to run the scripts. Make sure to change the directory of the dataset to one that works on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Latest Python Version: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Latest R Version: https://www.r-project.org/about.html

I personally use the Anaconda Distribution. It makes downloading what you need a breeze. You can find it here:https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python
